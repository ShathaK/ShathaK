Hello all, I hope you're all enjoying your day.
Just wanted a few tips and advice on how to help my Oslo.
Recently I took him vet for his vaccination and the Vet has advised me that he's overweight.
Can anyone help or advise me with a diet for my cat?!!

I had to share this as it's just happened.
Every single night I have to carry Matilda to bed in her box,
some nights she doesn't want to go & will throw herself down in the box in a right old mood :)
